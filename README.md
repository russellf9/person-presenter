# Person Presenter App

## Motivation

I've created this app for the following reasons:
1. Do some Angular so I can diversify my skills
2. See how different the latest Angular is to React and the old AngualrJS
3. See how working with Angular is really like!
4. See how quickly I can get an effective app up and running
5. See how difficult it would be to add Typescript to the project


## Features / Systems to add
[ ] Typescript
[ ] Unit testing
[ ] Routes
[ ] Snapshot tests
[ ] SASS
[ ] Mobile View
[ ] Embed fonts
[ ] Add Search functionality
